### Project

We're producing a simple map to help people find health centers in the
Philadelphia area. Our application has two goals:

First, we'd like to provide this data in javascript arrays. We should
print these arrays to the console.
* On application start, use `console.log` to show an array of arrays
  in which the first sub-array contains keys and the rest of the arrays
  contain the 'rows' of our data

Second, we want to know where the health centers are located within the
zip codes from 19140 to 19149 (inclusive).
* All and only markers found within the zip code range from 19140 to
  19149 should appear
* Each marker should have custom content that comes up in a dialog when
  clicked which tells us the location name

#### Extra

Some health centers offer dental services as well. Can you find a way to
give centers that provide dental services a different icon than those
that do not?
